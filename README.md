# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
A client is interested in learning how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates as well as their funding goal. The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate our Excel knowledge of creating new columns based on data in other columns, creating and filtering pivot tables, creating visualizations including such as charts and pivot charts, and saving them as a png.

## Results

- Findings: What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  -  Based on the data from the table:
There are 1,369 theater fundraisers, in which 839 were successful, 493 failed and 37 were canceled.  Overall, there is greater theater success at approximately twice the amount of theater failure outcomes. 
  -  Based on the Visualization: 
      -  Every month there are greater theater success outcomes compared to theater failure outcomes, with cancelations being very minimal across months.
      - There is a common trend line for both theater success and failures.  Starting from January to May and then a general decrease, with a small dip in October.
      - Theater success outcomes have greater volatility ranging from 111-37, where theater failure outcomes range from 52-31.  Theater success outcomes are best in the month of May than June but do well overall in the consecutive months of April- August, with a Feb.

- Findings: What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  -  Based on the data from the table:
      - Majority of the data is under the $150,000 goal mark.
      - Success outcomes are higher than failure outcomes in the lower goal ranges including from less than $19,999 and below.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
   - Limitations: One of the limitations of this data set is that most of the data is under the $150,000 goal mark.  This would make one question with some more how much the higher goals skew the overall data and if there are any outliers.  When comparing percentages graphically one is unable to see 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- - A box and whiskers plot would be useful to see if there are any outliers.  A bar chart would be useful to show the number of successful outcomes vs. failed outcomes, this could still include the overall percentage using markers.
