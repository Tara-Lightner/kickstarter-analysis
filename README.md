# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
A client is interested in learning how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates as well as their funding goal. The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate our Excel knowledge of creating new columns based on data in other columns, creating and filtering pivot tables, creating visualizations including such as charts and pivot charts, and saving them as a png.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data from the table there are 1,369 theater fundraisers, in which 839 were successful, 493 failed and 37 were canceled.  Theater success outcomes have greater volatility ranging from 111-37, where theater failure outcomes range from 52-31.  Theater success outcomes are best in the month of May than June but do well overall in the consecutive months of April- August, with a Feb.  Overall, there is greater theater success at approximately twice the amount of theater failure outcomes.  As seen in the pivot chart every month there are greater theater success outcomes compared to theater failure outcomes, with cancelations being very minimal across months.  Also of note is the common trend line for both theater success and failures.  Starting from January to May and then a general decrease, with a small dip in October.

### Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the data from the table majority of the data is under the $150,000 goal mark, with roughly 30 data points or more, then it trickles down to 12 data points or under. Success outcomes are higher than failure outcomes in the lower goal ranges including from less than $19,999 and below. The success and faliures criss cross overone another have many high and low ebs and flows.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not understand why we aggrigated the data for Outcomes based on Goals vs. using a pivot table/chart.  I had to play with the data further and get some help in office hours.  But I now understand that piviot tables help to aggrigate data, but in this instance we aggragated the data in a table and then created a chart.

## Results

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date Conclusion
      1.) Overall, there is greater theater success outcomes as theater failure outcomes. 
      2.) The best times to run a campaign would be in the months of May and June.

### Outcomes Based on Goals Conclusion
Success outcomes are best when keep the goal below $20,000 and below.
### Limitations: 
One of the limitations of this data set is that most of the data is under the $20,000 goal mark.  This would make one question with some more how much the higher goals skew the overall data and if there are any outliers.  When comparing percentages graphically one is unable to see how it relates to part of the whole.  For example, is 100% really good if there was only one goal in that range?
### Other possible tables and/or graph
A box and whiskers plot would be useful to see if there are any outliers.  A bar chart would be useful to show the number of successful outcomes vs. failed outcomes, this could still include the overall percentage using markers.
